The Far Daviolo I think it’s called with calamari salmon mussels over linguini noodles and marinara sauce.  Omg it was soooo good… it did say it was suppose to be spicy, but it was not which was not a problem. It was still great without the “kick”. And to end the night, dessert I tried was the tiramisu…OMG, I don’t even know how to explain it. What they say it was made of, you tasted it in every bite. Highly recommend 10/10\n",

We had the fried calamari and roasted veggies for appetizers, a couple of pizzas - margherita and short rib, and a few of us ordered entrees.  The chicken parm was delicious.

Once the food arrived, we were not impressed with the flavor or the presentation given the price point. $22 for a shrimp salad that had 4 shrimp. A baked spaghetti that came out like spaghetti soup.\n",

The restaurant was crowded. My husband walked up to the host stand to see if he could assist in getting the check after we waited 20 minutes & the host said “you have to talk to the waitress about that”. My husband said the reason we’re asking is that it’s been a long time. (we obviously know how restaurants work, and that you get the check from the waitress).  The host did not try to contact our waitress, and when he walked by her from our vantage point, he didn’t tell her we were asking for our check. I know it’s not the host’s normal job and I know we have to ask the waitress but it’s also unusual to wait 20 minutes after you’re done eating for someone to drop off the check. The host could’ve been more helpful.\n",

Seated quicky and service was prompt (so fast, in fact, that it threw off my pre-show schedule, but that's not a bad thing). Food was very good. Pizza is excellent thin-crust and crunchy for those who like their pizza with crispy crust. Lemonade was rated as \"delicious\" by my kids with an expressed desire to return with a large container and take some to-go. Saw lots of tables filled with late-teen / 20-something groups. Only down-side for us was the noise volume, which required raised voices for any kind of cross table conversation.\n",

The food was good, but not great. Too many items on the menu are fried. Even my eggplant parm which tasted good, was made with so heavily fried slices of eggplant that I only was able to eat about 1/3 of the dish(same for the chicken parm—-heavy thick fried breading)The shareable Caesar salad should have been very cold and wasn’t, like it was sitting out of fridge.

      "Processing review: Pietros has been our favorite restaurant for several years.  Recently we have noticed a deterioration in the quality and the portions of the entrees- particularly the spaghetti and meatballs.  The portion of pasta has definitely shrunk as has the size of the meatballs.  And the meatballs do not taste as good as before- last night they were over salted.   We are very disappointed and plan to search for a new favorite restaurant- I’m sure it won’t be hard to find one in this neighborhood.\n",

There was no soap in the dispenser.  In todays world that’s a nasty signal isn’t it?  Pizza was average and always a philly flaw putting too much cheese on the pizza and drowning it.  Salad was a Caesar and was typical and nothing special.  The size was for 2 but looked like it was for 1.  The Sangiovese wine was excellent!\n",

The pizza is cooked perfectly and the crust is very flavorful. I love that Pietros doesn’t scrimp on the toppings like some artisanal pizza places. They’re menu has a wide variety of Italian dishes but I definitely recommend the pizza! Service is also great. We were seated immediately and our waitress was so sweet. Looking forward to coming back again soon.\n",

      "Processing review: The food was amazing and the service was good as well. My only issue is because when our server noticed we were there for a birthday, I had made a reservation online and specifically noted that that was the celebration, he told us we could pick a dessert, making it sound like it would be on the house, but when we got the bill, the dessert was on there. I paid and left, not wanting to make it a big deal, but having been offered a dessert when we weren’t going to get one and having to pay for it was a little off putting. Other than that, I would go back and recommend this place to others\n",

However, no engagement or apologies given while the line snaked through the entry and bar waiting to get a table (25min after our reservation btw).  It happened after we waited and waited. Server was good enough but they were sold out of chicken & eggplant parm (@7:30pm) and we discovered it after we ordered and he came back to share.  Then i decided to order a 4 cheese pizza and add pepperoni and they refused to make the accommodation.   Would need to create my own pizza. At that point it would been over $40 for a 14 in pizza.  Not happening.  Overall food was good after it arrived.  I ordered a size if meatball prior to the pizza serving and they came when there was one piece left. Just felt like I was just another number - take it or leave it mentality in an industry which needs us to keep them alive - and we did during Covid and will continue to do it. Unless you “don’t care” and they didn’t.  So, we won’t be back.\n",

I ordered the chicken parm and my boyfriend ordered pizza with chicken sausage & roasted peppers. My chicken parm was perfect, it came with a side of spaghetti and the noodles were soo thick and fresh. The chicken was nice and hot and it was fried perfectly. The pizza was really good as well, I can't give my honest reviews cause i ate it cold when we got home but my boyfriend loved it.\n",

She ended up apologizing when I showed her my confirmation on my phone but the interaction was a bit off.  \n",
      "I also noted on the reservation we were celebrating a birthday, mentioned it two times in front of the server, and there was no type of recognition/offering/comp done. Just odd that there wasn't anything done for the birthday, even a \"happy birthday\" from the server. \n",
      "The calamari was flavorless. Also odd that you don't include lemons to squeeze on it. We would have asked the server but she was gone for long periods of time. \n",
      "In addition to the long periods she was gone, my boyfriend's water wasn't filled once during the meal until we had dessert. What was worse was that the person I assumed was a manager (based off the way they were dressed) delivered our dessert and didn't offer to fill the empty water glass that we had intentionally placed on the outside of the table to be noticed. \n",
      "We had to ask for a dessert menu as the server didn't offer it and just assumed we were ready for a check. Again, terrible to experience with a birthday celebration. \n",
      "For a $120 meal, it just really wasn't up to par. Again, things are rough right now for the industry, but with a price tag attached to things - filling a water glass and recognizing a birthday shouldn't go unnoticed.\n",

      "Processing review: Went in yesterday for lunch with a friend. Our service was awesome and that’s the best part of this review. The food was unfortunately bland. The caprese appetizer was the best part of my meal, but there was no salt, no pepper. The chicken parm lacked flavor and I couldn’t eat it. Our server was nice enough to take it and I ordered the fried mozzarella and even they were lackluster. No seasoning within the breading. Not the best experience - makes sense as to why we were the only table in the outdoor area the whole time we were there.\n",

The servers were attentive and explained several of the menu options. We split a Caesar salad that easily could have been a meal for one of use. The dressing was particularly tasty. We got the fettuccine Alfredo and chick Parmesan. Both were delicious and healthy portions that we couldn’t finish. Our only complaint would be that the rolls were kinda lacking in flavor.\n",

Pizza (burrata cheese, pistachio, arugula, mortadella and honey) was excellent; appetizers (fried cauliflower and calamari) also very good. The experience was kind of sullied by a panhandler who interrupted our dinner and became aggressive and hostile when we politely turned down his ask for a meal. The waitstaff did not intervene and ask him to leave. Not the restaurant’s fault per se but unpleasant nonetheless.\n",

We went with roasted veggies, Bolognese with zucchini noodles and a huge salad. All were absolutely delicious! So good, that I returned the next day for lunch with someone else.

The waitress only stopped at our table twice during this period to refill our waters and tell us that the kitchen was backed up. The first time the waitress came by (after 40 mins) she told us the pizzas would be out any minute. Then we proceeded to wait another half an hour before getting our food. We watched every other table that was seated after us receive pizzas before us. The server wasn’t even apologetic. Normally, we like Pietro’s. This experience was pretty horrendous though and we will rethink before dining here again.\n",

The service was great but the best part was the delicious and reasonably priced lunch we had.  From appetizers to drinks, to entrees, our total tab came to just over $100 for three, (including 5 drinks.)  Although the luncheon menu probably serves smaller portions than the regular menu, it was more than enough great tasting food to send us on our way with full bellies, and a determination to return soon.  We would definitely recommend putting Pietro's on your list of to-do eateries if you haven't been yet.  And if you already have, you know how good it is so go again and enjoy.\n",

Given COVID restrictions, Pietros has build a three walled structure with spacing and plastic between tables to ensure safe dining. There are heaters inside so even though it was only about 40 degrees we were comfortable the whole time. All servers are masked. The food was absolutely delish; although they no longer have a brunch menu, just lunch. The grilled vegetables, shrimp, risotto and Parmesan chicken were all excellent. They still do $5 brunch drinks on Sunday, which we sampled all of and were all excellent. Our server was incredibly kind and attentive. I highly recommend Pietros.\n",

The other food was ok. This is not my favorite restaurant for food, but my young adult kids were in town and I take them to Pietro's because they love the Bolognese sauce.

Their Rigatoni Alla Vodka from Pietro's is my FAVORITE vodka sauce pasta so I had to get it like always  My boyfriend got the Short Rib Pizza which had short rib, caramelized onion & a truffle alfredo sauce. Our waiter recommended and pointed out that the sauce was not too heavy or over bearing like we were worried about, and boy was he right! It was the perfect combination, have never seen a pie like it before so happy we tried it! The dough to the pizza as always was amazing, they don't call it a Coal Oven Pizza for nothing!!\n",

They added a ton of tables to their sidewalk/street, all evenly spaced out with plenty of room for passersby to walk through without interrupting the diners. I was lucky to get a table right by the edge of the street, which was blocked off by a gate so the traffic wasn't a disruption. There were umbrellas over every table, blocking most of the sun and heat. This was my favorite weekend brunch/lunch spot pre-COVID, and that hasn't changed at all with the 'new normal' of outdoor dining. All of the staff were wearing masks and maintained distancing while clearing off tables and replacing the paper tablecloths. Can't wait to return!\n",

With gloves staff is less likely to wash their hands/use sanitizer. The gloves were not changed between tables. Other than COVID recc. I would visit this resturant under normal conditions again.\n",

So after I wrote that last review the restaurant replied saying next time request a seat in the back so I did on my reservation and wen I got to the restaurant not only were we not seated in the back with a bigger table I was seated at the same damn small bar table as the last time wen I submitted my review plenty of four tops in the back but god forbid two People have that table. Me and my husband get a lot of food and are great tippers so you know what I’ll take my business elsewhere. Don’t go to pietros unless ur are a big table.

Also, I asked if I could substitute the pork in a pasta for sausage and the waiter said that it would be an up-charge of no more than $8, which seems pretty ridiculous. I’m not adding anything to the pasta, it’s a substitution. If anything, it should’ve been $2-3 up-charge at most. Will not be revisiting this place.\n",

Many people were waiting to be seated so I highly recommend making a reservation. The server got our drink order pretty quick and then followed up shortly for our dinner order. Service fell off a bit after that....had to ask several times for things but the food was delicious.  We had pizza, fried mozzarella, eggplant parmesan, and cheese raviolis which filled us completely leaving no room for dessert. We would definitely go back for another meal.\n",

We had originally had reservations at a different restaurant but were highly unsatisfied with our order so we decided to look for something else. We're both huge pizza lovers but felt really overdressed for a pizza place. I am so glad we found your restaurant and we've made it a monthly thing to have a date night here. Thank you for the great service, food and ambiance!! Can't wait to go back next month!!\n",

      "Processing review: Last night, my GF and I went to Pietro's. We ordered Caesar salad and pizza for our entree's and asked for them to come out at the same time. The salad came out way before the pizza, which must have been a slight communication but just wasnt desired. We also asked if we could split a pizza (half of two pizzas). Our bartender indicated we could and gave no information that we could perhaps incur a charge for this. The pizza was decent and the salad was somewhat subpar ($19 for a chicken Caesar salad... should've been at most $12. Nothing special). \n",
      "\n",
      "When we got the check I realized the numbers didn't quite add up to what I had expected. The bartender rang in the pizza as a custom pizza which resulted in a much greater charge than the stated menu price. The medium pizza is $20. Ours came out to $28.25. A 40% markup for a split pizza is honestly ridiculous. It is not like the restaurant incurs a greater cost.  But that isn't the main issue... we were never informed of this. Had we been told it would cost any more, we would not have elected to get this pizza and would have chosen another option. When I brought this to the attention of the bartender, she wasn't entirely sympathetic so I promptly asked for a manager. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dave, the manager that came down, explained to us what happened. Apparently she had to ring it in as a custom pizza with a ton of add-ons. I told Dave that this ought to be conveyed to a customer. No one in their right mind would pay $28.25 for the pizza we got. He agreed there was a communication fault and adjusted the bill a bit. Apparently, it was rang in incorrectly (entirely the bartender's fault), and he took off some more. The final cost came to $22 for the pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if I realized a customer of mine was not properly informed of additional pricing, I would make sure (at minimum) that the bill reflected the menu price due to the communication error. Unfortunately, Dave did not do this. Dave decided to tag the $2 extra, which just seems petty at that\n",

The thing that really made my jaw drop was my granddaughters PLAIN pasta, and by plain I mean no butter, no sauce, no cheese, nothing.  The charge was $9 for her 25 penne noodles.   My other granddaughter had the penne with butter and hers cost $8!  Totally outrageous price for.50 cents worth of pasta.  Again, service was friendly and efficient.\n",

My son had pizza (you can never go wrong with their pizza!) and I had the chicken & shrimp with zucchini noodles. I asked for just olive oil & garlic instead of blush sauce and the chef made it perfectly!  Our waiter Christian was great!  Super attentive!  The food can be a little pricey, but it's worth it!  I would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner & ask to sit in Christian's station.\n",

Terrific food -- pizza and pasta.  I highly recommend the short rib pizza, which has a light Alfredo sauce instead of the usual red sauce, mozzarella, sauteed onions, and a generous portion of short ribs.  It's a different kind of pizza experience, and so delicious that you'll wonder why every restaurant doesn't serve it.\n",

      "Processing review: The food is delicious especially the Sicilian salad, house special pizza and vegetarian appetizer. Nice selection of wine. Unfortunately the waitress was inattentive to our basic needs. I had to ask the waitress for basket of wonderful Italian rolls, I’m accustomed of having the rolls, olive oil and balsamic vinegar served after the water is poured. After selecting an Italian sparkling wine I had to ask the waitress to fill my glass and she required verbal cuing to fill my friend’s glass.  I gave the waitress the benefit of the doubt (maybe having a bad day) as she received 20%  gratuity and she did not acknowledge the gratuity. \n",

The table they put us at was pretty terrible, it was next to where the servers came to put in the orders, so it was nonstop traffic-not to mention we were at two different shaped tables which made chatting difficult.  The food was pretty good, but it didn't come out at the same time, not the end of the world since we were a large group. Our server was nice enough, but his service was awful.  He never remembered our drinks, or Parmesan cheese, and had to be asked repeatedly to refill our waters.  He told someone that something was gluten free and it clearly wasn't and they ran out of lasagna by 6:30 on a Saturday  night...which is super disappointed.  \n",

      "Processing review: Pietro's Coal Oven Pizza is a local neighborhood (Rittenhouse Square) favorite.  The restaurant serves traditional Italian food - pastas, pizzas, meat and fish dishes) - large portions, (single and family size) delicious food, and has reasonable pricing.  Nothing creative here - just good old fashioned Italian food.  The restaurant is usually crowded.  The servers are always friendly, professional, and efficient, despite the hectic pace of the restaurant.  One word of caution, as if the restaurant is crowded, it will be noisy.  My only complaint about Pietro's is the noise level.  It is very difficult to carry on a conversation in the restaurant.   It is not the best choice for intimate dining.  However, that being said, if you enjoy delicious traditional Italian food, hang with some friends, and pay a decent price for a meal, Pietro's Coal Oven Pizza on Walnut Street is your place.\n",

      "Processing review: Pietro's is an excellent Italian restaurant in the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City.  The restaurant has always served delicious, traditional Italian food on a consistent basis.  The portions are large (enough to take home left overs) and the prices are very reasonable.  There are a variety of pizzas, enough to satisfy everyone's palate.  The same can be said of the salads, main courses (pasta, chicken, veal, and seafood).  Reservations are recommended as the restaurant fills up quickly - especially on a Saturday night.  (Best to book in advance and choose an earlier time slot).  With the large number of customers, the noise level rises.  It can be difficult to have a conversation others when the restaurant is extremely busy.  The noise level is the only drawback for this very fine restaurant.  The servers are amazing - hard working, cheerful, efficient, and professional at all times.  A little bit of patience with the servers is recommended during busy hours, considering the number of patrons in the restaurant.  To summarize, for superior, classic Italian dishes (and pizza) for a very reasonable price, Pietro's is highly recommended.\n",

But I must forewarn you, however, arrive at this restaurant with an appetite since the portion sizes for their dishes are large. Sharing of dishes is encouraged and recommended. I had the pasta bolognese and it was delicious. Others in my party had italian salads and they loved them as well...Service was excellent and attentive although I felt the pricing of the dishes was a bit on the high side. Overall great visit though with great Italian food to boot!\n",

When the large parties left, the noise level was more pleasurable. A later reservation would be wise if you want to avoid the high noise level. Also we like to sit in booths on our dates, and there are only tables. We'd still go back for a late dinner because the pizza was undeniably the best we've had in the area.\n",

Then salads just minutes later. No food for children. So they ate rolls and had sugary drinks. Reheated mussels showed up about  time pizza was served. With everything on table, there was not enough room to eat. It was a confused evening likely the result of poor service by our server.\n",

There were four of us attending a conference. We were seated immediately while those without reservations had a 45-minute wait. The menu is not extensive but more than sufficient. Be warned. The portions are big, which includes a small (not family-style) salad. The shared appetizer was the meatballs. Fabulous. We also had the calamari, prepared perfectly, crisp and not rubbery. Three of us shared a small salad (very good) & we couldn't finish it. The shared entree was the eggplant parmigiana, a huge platter, which was enough for 6 people. It was about the best we have ever eaten, including the sauce & accompanying pasta. No dessert but a perfect cappuccino ended the meal. Combined with reasonable prices given the quality of the food, Pietro's was near perfect. And as busy was our waiter, he managed to provide excellent service.\n",

I started with the Caesar salad, and it was meh -- but quite large and suitable for sharing.  Overall, recommended for a good quick bite, but hardly a dining experience.\n",

      "Processing review: Second time at Pietro's near Rittenhouse Square. Had another very good experience. Was crowded when we got there with a line out the door, but they had our table ready for us when we arrived so got seated right away.  In our group we had the rissoto balls, a pizza, the bruschetta, pasta bolegnese, salmon and chicken limone (w/sub of veggies for pasta). Everything we ordered was delicious. My 16 yo son said it was probably the best bolognese he's ever had (and he orders it all the time). The sub veggies for pasta was probably the best veggie substitute I have ever had.  Portions were generous and food was fresh and we all loved what we had ordered. Service was attentive.  Was visiting the area from another state but will definitely make Pietro's a regular stop for a really great casual dinner during our trips here.\n",

We were seated in the front section of the dining room by the bar and it was a nice pizzeria type feel...casual yet not cheap.  Saw there was another large area upstairs that also looked very nice.  We had 7pm reservations on a Tuesday and it was busy, but there were plenty of tables and we were seated right away.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Drink orders were taken and soft rolls and olive oil were brought to the table.   We ordered a salad to share and 3 different pasta dishes. The \"small\" salad was very big and was plenty for 2-3 people to share as a salad b/f the meal.  Our main entrees (ravioli, spaghetti marinara and pasta bolegnese) were all enjoyed.  We are not from Philadelphia, but will definitely come back here next time we are in town.\n",

      "Processing review: I want this place to be so much better. For starters, every time I have gone, the service is not great. The servers take forever to get around to you, and even if they start off attentive, it drops quickly (i.e. don't check back, refill drinks, etc.).  The last couple of times I've gone, it took a long time for the appetizers to come out, then the dinner comes out almost immediately, before we've even had a chance to finish half of the starters. The starters are also wildly over priced. A bowl of mussels is $14, they came out in a small bowl with more than a few missing (as in, the mussel had fallen out of the shell, and wasn't in the broth), and the remaining were miniscule.  $12 for caprese salad.  $11 for a caesar salad. And to be clear, there's nothing special about any of these dishes. The mussels come in a standard red or white sauce (though even if they were in some kind of special broth, I'd be annoyed at the quality). The caprese is standard mozzarella and tomatoes. Caesar salad is exactly that. Fortunately, the entrees are better. They are reasonably priced for a lot of food, usually enough for leftovers. The entrees are really the only reason I would continue to go back, although, I would absolutely pick one of the many inexpensive BYO Italian restaurants over Pietro's.\n",

Server also seemed hurried and bothered by us not knowing exactly what we wanted. Having said this, if you're not looking for dessert you'll likely be pleased with the food.\n",

The reservation was for 6:30 and we did not get sat until after 7:00.  There were four kids with us and one ordered something off the menu that they just ran out of - if we were sat on time, he would have been able to eat it.  The host kept apologizing, but never offered us anything in return (ie:  appetizer or dessert on the house).  The food is always good, but I felt like the table situation could have been avoided.  The host told us to wait because he was waiting for a table to fit us, in the end, he sat us at a table for 6 and squeezed 8 of us at this table...\n",

This is the one place that has continued to adapt to every aspect and change in my life and has never disappointed. No matter how many of the new, fancy places I go to, I always come back to Pietro's. Even my out of town friends, even those all the way from California, always ask to make a Pietro's run when they visit Philly.

It was also delicious and more than enough for the two of us. We took home the leftovers to save room for dessert. I had the peach sorbet and my husband had the chocolate mousse. They were both superb. We noticed many dishes being served to others. They all looked very plentiful. We also noted tables that could easily accommodate 6-10 diners. The choice of dishes served family style also added to the feeling this would be a great place for group dining. We will be back, hopefully with friends.\n",

We got a pizza which was delicious and very quickly made.  We went relatively early for dinner since we were going to a show so it wasn't that crowded but was picking up when we left.  Very cute inside as well.  Overall, really glad I chose here for dinner and I would go back.\n",

      "Processing review: I would rate this restaurant as average. I went on a Saturday night around 7 pm. It's not bad, but definitely not fine dining. If you want a reasonably affordable Italian dinner without all the bells and whistles of an upscale place, then this is a good spot. The food was decent (my date got a salad, I got the chicken limone, which I would get again). The ambience is a little loud, but reasonable. The service could have been better. Waiter was very brief and said as little as possible without any warm embellishments.  I found myself regularly looking around for him when I needed a drink refill. I understand they were busy- it was a Saturday night after all. I would go back only as a safe bet for affordable Italian that's near my apartment. I'll be trying other Italian restaurants in the meantime.\n",

We think maybe the waitress might have forgotten to put the pizza order in or something. When we finally got our pizzas they were cold to warm.  Two of the pizzas were over cooked with dark black crust. It was very disappointing. Especially since I know they can do better. I work in town and we eat there all the time. The kids were starving and then they were crowded so we ate what we could of the pizza. I was sorry I suggested the location. I would give it another try.  I am hoping this was just a fluke.

So, if there is a speciality pizza that you are considering and there's an ingredient you wish to omit or exchange, best to build your own pie then ordering by name. That would be the only downfall to this amazing family style resturaunt.\n",

I have previously visited Pietro's for lunch and for drinks, so it seemed like it would be a laid-back place to get a good meal. Service was good to start, apps and drinks came out quickly. We order the bruchetta and the calamari. Both were tasty though the bruchetta was three large pieces, kind of an awkward portion for sharing. Our entrees took a little longer to arrive, and it would have been nice for the server to check on us to see if we wanted more drinks, etc. When the entrees came out, I had ordered eggplant parm, and a friend of mine order chicken parm. The servers were unable to tell which was which and gave us the wrong dish, which I found kind of strange that the servers could not recognize their own dishes. The food itself was average, however, towards the end of the meal, my friend who ordered the chicken parm noticed something in the chicken. Turned out to be a folded up receipt layered in between pieces of the chicken! By that point, the rest of us had lost our appetite and it took a good 5 minutes or so before we were able to get our server's attention to explain what had happened. She seemed to blow it off as an accident that happens, and while she took his meal off the check, it was very disturbing that a folded receipt somehow ended up in the food. While I have dined at Pietro's on numerous occasions and have always had an enjoyable meal, I will not be returning after this incident and the restaurant's indifference to, in my eyes, a huge health risk.\n",

I cannot begin to tell you how wonderful our server, William, took care of us. He was so attentive (even though it was a very busy evening). My parents can be a handful and both of them made it a point to say that he was the best server they had ever had- a true professional.

The risotto and the outer crust were great but the filling lacked one key component-peas---- and the ground meat was almost non existent and the cheese was clumped instead of evenly melted. They tasted good so we ate them. Next we ordered a 4 cheese pizza-this was delicious. I am not big on pizza but this pizza was beyond good-the cheese combo was perfect. \n",

This truly classic Italian family-style restaurant has traditional ambiance with Sinatra, Martin, and opera in the background. The food is precisely priced to be accessible to the average yuppie, and it's incredibly tasty. I have never been disappointed with the quality of service or the quality of food. After probably 30 visits, I continue to enjoy every bite as much as the first visit. I have never had a poor experience here, and they were even able to accommodate multiple large parties of people in their dining area without any interruption or drop in service quality.\n",

The place was not noisy as some reviewers have stated, but at 6pm on a Sunday, it wasn't full yet.  It took a long time for the waitress to take our drink orders, but after that, the service was good.  They have a decent craft beer selection, which for me is a must with pizza.  We ordered two \"small\" Arugula salads to share, although one would have been big enough for four since they are huge.  We followed that with a Gardinera and Pietro's Classic coal-fired pizzas.  Both pizzas were good but not outstanding.  Overall, we had a nice dining experience.\n",

My 13month old was good but as kids do, made a bit of a mess on the floor. My sister bent down with several napkins and cleaned up the whole mess and had it wrapped in the napkin to pick up, then the manager comes over and make a big show of grabbing the napkin, thereby throwing everything there was under it all over the floor again and precedes to wipe the floor with his foot.  Then he came back and did it again and again and again all while we were still there trying to finish our meal.  As I started packing up the cleaning crew came in and took away all our plates and drinks and we weren't even done yet.  They grabbed the highchair and nudged me out of the way to set up the table for the next reservation.  I have never been treated so rudely in all the restaurants I have been too with my children.  When my mom tried to talk to the manager about his behavior he ignored her and pushed her away, told us we were a hazard, then walked away.  DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE.  IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN. THE FOOD WAS TERRIBLE ANYWAY.\n",

      "Processing review: My mom was in town just for the night so my husband and I decided to take her to a casual but nice dinner on a Friday night. There were multiple reservations times open at Pietro’s so we opted for 8pm. My mom and I got there at 7:30 and checked in with the hostess for our 8pm reservation. About 15 minutes later my husband arrived so I checked in with her again and let her know we were all 3 here and would be waiting at the bar. We all got a drink to tie us over but while sitting there we saw multiple walk-ins get sat ahead of us. Right at 8pm my husband went over just to check on our status. The hostess acted as if she didn’t know about our reservation and then said she would get us sat as soon as possible. Another 20 minutes passed – and other tables were sat but then she finally came to us – however she tried to give us a table that was too crowed to even sit at, and was covered in crumbs – no one had even cleaned it yet. We had made it clear before that we wanted to sit in the upper space, which she said was no problem but now, at 8:20pm after being there almost an hour she tried to give us the worst table in the place. The manager then came over (by mistake we think) and said he would accommodate us in the upper space in less than 5 minutes. However, 10 more minutes went by and it was obvious he was doing everything he could to avoid us. In the meantime, I called Seraphina across the street who told us they would be happy to make room for us. At that point we’d had enough – we left and went to Seraphina. We did however have a fantastic dinner at Seraphina. The food was incredible, the service was great and the night was salvaged. Coming from a family that owns a restaurant we understand the business. We know that nights get busy and things get crazy but we do not understand how the service and treatment we received at Pietro’s is even remotely acceptable.\n",

They wanted to change a topping on a pizza (and would have paid for the change) which is usually not a problem in most italian restaurants. However, the server was adamant that the pizzas had to be served without any changes - understandable for many reasons but he wasn't that smooth about it. They said that his personality changed from being very nice and fun to being stern and almost unpleasant - he needs to take a Social Skills 101 class. No server should make diners feel awkward if they want to make a change to pizza toppings.\n",

My husband's pasta dish was terrific. The service was excellent....the waiter was attentive and polite but not intrusive. It was refreshing that he did not try to upsell, nor did they rush us or try to remove our plates the second we put our fork down. I would definitely recommend. The specialty pizzas looked amazing. Very upbeat atmosphere.\n",

Although my party only had pizza, other diner's plates looked very good. Good beer selection, with plenty on tap. Great location on Walnut St, with sidewalk dining as well as plenty of space inside and at the bar (it does get crowded here).\n",

I've been to many Italian restaurants in Philly, and though many are good, none serve the basic Italian fare that one thinks of when one thinks Italian. My guest and I shared two entrees--baked ziti and spaghetti/meatballs--and they were both amazing! I can't wait to go back to order something else. We sat outside, and it was just perfect. The prices are more than reasonable and the portions are generous. I highly recommend this place...one of my new favorite Italian places in Philly!\n",

The salads are large and very good, but my favorite appetizer is the roasted vegetable plate. It is beautifully done with two good cheeses and roasted peppers and artichokes among the veggies. The best pizza is the barese (great sausage!), but all the traditional 13\"ers are terrific. Service is always friendly and fast.\n",
